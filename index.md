## Reporting research software in CRIS (Continuing Research Information Systems)

Research software is an eligible REF submission. However, the majority
of REF submissions are research publications. Indeed, refereeing 
research software is a difficult task, and reviewers may not have
clear guidelines for its evaluation for the REF purposes (something
else we need to work on), and many researchers prefer the safer route
of submitting papers. As a result, software outputs are not always
being recorded in Continuing Research Information Systems (CRIS)
used by universities. The first step here would be to help to
research software developers to find a way to record their outputs
in CRIS. This may not always be obvious, so on this website we provide
general guidelines and step-by-step system-specific instructions for
doing this.

Recording research software in CRIS is useful for many purposes,
not only for REF, and we encourage developers to report all your
software outputs there. 
[A survey of 15 Russell Group universities](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers)
found that 92% of researchers use research software, 67% find
it fundamental to their research, and 56% develop their own software.
To get further information, for example, an overview of all research
developed at an institution, in the research group or by an individual
developer, one could use CRIS or their public views (e.g. research
portals), provided they contain relevant records. This will provide
further evidence that software is vital for research, should be treated
as research output, and will make a stronger case for the campaign
for the recognition and adoption of the RSE role within academia,
lead by the [UK Research Software Engineer Association](https://rse.ac.uk/).

How to record research software in CRIS (Continuing Research Information Systems)

Different scenarios. What is minimal. What is recommended.

There are several broad categories of software which should be recorded in a
CRIS.

- Open-source software
- Closed source software for which executables can be made available
- Software projects which are unable to make any outputs available, but which can be publicly acknowledged
- Software projects which can not be publicly disclosed

For open-source software, we suggest that the project is archived using
[GitHub's integration with Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
(or similar), which will provide a DOI.

In our experience, a CRIS typically classifies a software output as a kind of
research output, effectively treating it as a special kind of paper. The exact
details will depend on the system in use and how it has been configured.

If open source software has been archived elsewhere, you should reference that
in the CRIS record; otherwise you can reference the source code repository.

If executables are to be shared, you can upload them to the CRIS or link to
them if they are hosted elsewhere.

You should be able to apply access restrictions to the record as appropriate.
