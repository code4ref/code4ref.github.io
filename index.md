## Summary

Why we recommend to record research software in
CRIS (Continuing Research Information Systems)

## General workflow

How to record research software in CRIS (Continuing Research Information Systems)

Different scenarios. What is minimal. What is recommended.

There are several broad categories of software which should be recorded in a
CRIS.

- Open-source software
- Closed source software for which executables can be made available
- Software projects which are unable to make any outputs available, but which can be publicly acknowledged
- Software projects which can not be publicly disclosed

You may wish to create a single record for a piece of software, or multiple
records for different versions of that software.

For open-source software, we suggest that the project is archived using
[GitHub's integration with Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
(or similar), which will provide a DOI.

In our experience, a CRIS typically classifies a software output as a kind of
research output, effectively treating it as a special kind of paper. The exact
details will depend on the system in use and how it has been configured.

If open source software has been archived elsewhere, you should reference that
in the CRIS record; otherwise you can reference the source code repository.

If executables are to be shared, you can upload them to the CRIS or link to
them if they are hosted elsewhere.

You should be able to apply access restrictions to the record as appropriate.
