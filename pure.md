# How to report software outputs in Pure

This guide has been written with reference to the Pure instance at the
University of St Andrews, which is version 5.13.1 at the time of writing.

Create a new Research Output from template **Non-textual form->Software**

Then you will see the following input form:

Enter details for **Publication status and dates**. **Published** and
**Unpublished** are likely to be the relevant options, with Published being
appropriate for open-source software.

Enter the publication information. Note that the mandatory **Original
language** field does not refer to programming and languages.

Leave **Media of output** as **No value**.

Add **Contributors**. **Developer** is likely the most useful role; **Author**
may be suitable for writers od documentation. There is no suitable role for
maintainers, testers etc. - you should use **Other**.

Change the **Managing organisational unit** if necessary.

Add **Publisher** information. Potentially relevant options such as GitHub and
Zenodo may already be available, or they can be created.

**Electronic version(s), and related files and links** is where you can link to
an external resource and/or upload files. In particular, if you have a DOI you
should add it here, along with details of the applicable license.

If adding any **keywords**, try and be consistent with what you have used
elsewhere (e.g. on GitHub) but try and avoid creating new keywords
unnecessarily.

Add details of any **Relations** the record has to any existing records in Pure
- **Research Outputs** (papers), **Activities**, **Projects**, **Datasets** etc.

Set the **Visibility** according to how you wish the record to be available.

Click **Save** to complete the entry.
